# WeatherApp
This app is a weather app developed in Jetpack Compose and to give the user up to date weather information about any city. One can enter the name of the city and the app gets information about it through the OpenWeatherMap API, presenting the name of the city, the current temperature, the lowest and the highest one, the type of weather, and a relevant weather icon. Its interface is up-to-date, having a gradient background, glassmorphism, lookalike cards, and fluent loading and updating of data. It has exception management on bad inputs or API errors with a particular option to retry as well as optimized on Android devices to provide smooth usage to the user.
